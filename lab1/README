L2error() ->	iterates through solution (not ghost cells) and adds (a[i] - sin(x[i]+u*t))^2
				sqrts sum
				divide by # of points	

- L2error() is called every time step, right after update and the value is pushed back l2_error vector <double>
- writeError() prints out l2_error: time trace of the l2 error for the solution
